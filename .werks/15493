In 2.2, we moved a lot of internal UI code and removed implicitly imported
names to reduce unclear situations. This helps our internal code structure, but
may cause issues for existing extensions which were relying on these moved or
removed names.<br><br>

It is important to note that such code restructuring is part of the continuous
improvement and evolution of Checkmk. These changes can lead to more efficient
workflows, improved features, and better performance.<br><br>

For 2.2 we tried to keep compatibility for the most extensions but could not
make sure to cover them all.<br><br>

Therefore, we would like to give you a few examples, how to adjust local
extensions if you see incompatibilities with Checkmk 2.2.<br>
Please note: Each example stands for one possible import problem, so the module
names are interchangeable.<br><br>

<b>Loading "metrics/my_custom_file" failed: No module named
'cmk.gui.plugins.metrics.check_mk'</b><br>

There is an import from the not existing module "cmk.gui.plugins.metrics.check_mk".
Check your plugin to see what is imported from there, e.g. "df_translation" and
add the import:

F+:metrics/my_custom_file
from cmk.gui.plugins.metrics.translation import df_translation
F-:

<b>Loading "views/my_custom_file" failed: name 'inventory_displayhints' is not
defined</b><br>

In earlier versions, an explicit import was not needed, with 2.2 you have to
add:

F+:views/my_custom_file
from cmk.gui.views.inventory.registry import inventory_displayhints
F-:

<b>Loading "wato/my_custom_file" failed: cannot import name
'RulespecGroupIntegrateOtherServices' from
'cmk.gui.plugins.wato.active_checks'</b><br>

The location of some modules may have changed. The simplest way to find the new
place is to grep for it in '~/lib/python3/cmk/gui' and adjust the import in
'my_custom_file':

F+:wato/my_custom_file
from cmk.gui.plugins.wato.active_checks.common import RulespecGroupIntegrateOtherServices
F-:

<b>Loading "wato/my_custom_file" failed: name 'socket' is not defined</b><br>

System modules like 'socket' have to be imported from 2.2 on, so please add:

F+:wato/my_custom_file
import socket
F-:

For Checkmk 2.3 we plan to introduce a fully described API to avoid such
adjustments with every major release in the future.<br><br>
