After cloning a site with <code>omd cp</code> or renaming it with <code>omd mv</code>, opening the agent bakery GUI
did result in a crash, showing a message like

C+:
Internal error: '/omd/sites/SITE/share/check_mk/agents/check_mk_agent.linux' is not in the subpath of '/omd/sites/SITE_COPY/share/check_mk/agents' OR one path is relative and the other is absolute.
C-:

As a workaround, you can delete the file <code>~/var/check_mk/wato/bakery_file_status.mk</code>
on the site.
