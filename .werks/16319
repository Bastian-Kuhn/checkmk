Title: Reduce context/search filter for "Metrics graph of a single service"

Since 2.2 the content element "Metrics graph of a single service" allowed to
configure multiple context/search filters.
This was wrong because this element is limited to e specific host and service.

This change should have no effect on your configuration but we recommend to
check reports with such content elements.
