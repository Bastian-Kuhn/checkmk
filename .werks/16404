Title: omd cp: Fix etc/ssl/agents/legacy_ca.pem Points to Source of Copy
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
Component: omd

Level: 1
Version: 2.2.0p25

Since Checkmk 2.2.0 there is a agent CA located in <code>etc/ssl/agents/</code>. This CA is
different from the site CA. In particular, if updating from 2.1.0 to 2.2.0,
Checkmk will create a symlink <code>etc/ssl/agents/legacy_ca.pem</code>, which points to
<code>etc/ssl/ca.pem</code>.  After performing an <code>omd cp</code>. This symlink would still point
to the site, which was the source of the copy. The symlink is now relative. If
the site was created with version 2.2.0 or above no symlink is needed.
