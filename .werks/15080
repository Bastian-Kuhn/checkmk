In distributed setups, several dashboards showed the "Site overview" dashlet where the "Host overview" makes more sense.
This is fixed to always showing hosts, i.e. the "Host overview" dashlet in the following dashboards:
LI: all cloud VM dashboards (AWS, Azure, GCP)
LI: most Kubernetes dashboards (Cluster, Deployment, DaemonSet, StatefulSet, Namespace)
LI: site specific dashboards titled: "Site dashboard <tt>site_name</tt>"
