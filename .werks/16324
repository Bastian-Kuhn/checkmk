Since NetApp has discontinued support for their old API this werk adds datasource program and check plugins for the new NetApp ONTAP REST API.

However, the new API does not provide certain metrics that were available in the old API. As a result, the new check plugins have been modified accordingly.

The plugins that have been migrated with this werk are the ones that monitor:

LI: NetApp aggregates
LI: NetApp node's CPUs
LI: NetApp disks
LI: NetApp sensors of environment and shelves
LI: NetApp node's fans
LI: NetApp node's interfaces
LI: NetApp LUNs
LI: NetApp node's ports
LI: NetApp power supply units
LI: NetApp volumes (and snapshots)
LI: NetApp (SVMs) Storage Virtual Machine's (formerly called "vservers‚Äù) traffic and status
