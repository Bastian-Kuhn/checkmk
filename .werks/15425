This Werk fixes a little detail that will be irrelevant for most users.<br>
It's best explained with an example.

Before:
C+:
$ ar x check_mk_agent.deb
$ tar tf control.tar.gz
postinst
preinst
prerm
control
conffiles
md5sums
C-:

Now:
C+:
$ ar x check_mk_agent.deb
$ tar tf control.tar.gz
.
./postinst
./preinst
./prerm
./control
./conffiles
./md5sums
C-:

While there's no advantage in packaging relative to "<tt>.</tt>",
it seems to be the expected format for <tt>control.tar.gz</tt> and <tt>data.tar.gz</tt>,
as we received some feedback about the <i>SUSE manager</i> not recognizing the .deb package otherwise.
