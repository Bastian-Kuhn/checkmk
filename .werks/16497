Title: agent_aws: Use proxy for connections to 'STS' client

Previously, if configured, proxy was used to connect to all clients except for the 'STS' client.
This led to a crash in the agent if 'STS' client was only accessible via proxy.
Now, the configured proxy will be used for the 'STS' client as well.
