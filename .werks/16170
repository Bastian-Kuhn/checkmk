Title: snmp: Store OID cache per context group

SNMP caching didn't take contexts in consideration when storing
OID data. This led to the same result being reported for the OID
in different sections even if sections use different contexts.

Now, SNMP caching stores fetched OID data for every group of contexts
it was called with.
