This werk addresses an issue identified by our QA team. Previously,
you could include the newline character in the 'name' field when
creating a contact_group, service_group or host_group via the
following endpoints

/domain-types/contact_group_config/collections/all
/domain-types/service_group_config/collections/all
/domain-types/host_group_config/collections/all

We have now made pattern matching stricter, which means that this
is no longer allowed.
