Previously, the single service discovery and the bulk discovery shared the same
documentation for the mode field. This covers the use cases for the bulk discovery
to a certain degree. This werk fixes this. In addition, this werk also
resolves previously non working modes 'fix_all' and 'tabula_rasa'.
