When removing hosts in subfolders, the <a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/15407">automatic removal of hosts</a>
did not remove the agent TLS registrations of these hosts. This unintended behavior interferred with
the auto-re-registration introduced in <a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/15658">werk 15658</a>.
