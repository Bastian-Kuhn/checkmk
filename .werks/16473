Title: Support host & service labels in CSV exports again

In <a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/13729">Werk #13729</a> support for labels
in CSV exports was removed (among other things). Instead, for affected columns
a constant <code>"NOT_CSV_EXPORTABLE"</code> value was exported.

This change reintroduces host & service labels as JSON serialized strings. This
only relates to CSV exports, other formats are not affected.

Sample export:

C+:
"host";"host_labels"
"test";"{""cmk\/os_platform"": ""linux"", ""cmk\/os_family"": ""linux"", ""cmk\/check_mk_server"": ""yes"", ""cmk\/site"": ""test""}"
"dummy";"{""my_label"": ""works""}"
"nothing";"{}"
C-:
