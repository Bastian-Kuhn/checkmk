Title: tag_group: change the identification field from 'ident' to 'id'

Before this Werk, when creating a tag group, the <strong>ident</strong> field was used to provide its identification as well as that of the tags associated to the group, however the information was returned in the <strong>id</strong> field. This Werk unifies the names and now the <strong>ident</strong> fields are renamed to <strong>id</strong>. Users should adapt their scripts accordingly.

For comptatibility reasons CheckMK 2.2.0 and 2.3.0 will support both <strong>id</strong> and <strong>ident</strong>, but <strong>ident</strong> will be removed on the next version.

The following example shows the changes that need to be applied to the payload to use this endpoint:

Original payload:

C+:
{
    "ident": "test_group",
    "title": "Test group",
    "help_text": "My test groupd",
    "tags": [
        {"ident": "test", "title": "Test Tag"}
    ]
}

Updated payload:

C+:
{
    "id": "test_group",
    "title": "Test group",
    "help_text": "My test groupd",
    "tags": [
        {"id": "test", "title": "Test Tag"}
    ]
}
