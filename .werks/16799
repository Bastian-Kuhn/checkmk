When configuring the metrics rendered in custom and forecast graphs, users have to select a host,
a service and a metric. Previously, if any of these fields were missing, the Checkmk UI displayed
the message "Cannot calculate graph recipes" and an uninformative traceback. As of this werk, the UI instead displays a descriptive error message.
