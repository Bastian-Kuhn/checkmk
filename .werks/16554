Title: df: Wrong handling of lower levels for free space
Class: fix

This is a regression since Checkmk 2.2.0.

When configuring the Service Monitoring Rule "Filesystems (used space and growth)",
configured levels for free space were evaluated incorrectly.

As a result, affected services erroneously showed up as <em>CRIT</em>.

This happened because of a wrong rounding while evaluating the levels, and only affected
small filesystems with a size below 1MB.
