Title: omd update: Fix setting world read permissions on etc and local files
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
Component: omd
Date: 1705690005
Edition: cre
Level: 1
Version: 2.2.0p20

Starting with 2.2.0 (see #15062), we use a umask of 0077 to prevent files and directories owned by
the site user from being world readable. However, when updating from the CRE to a non CRE edition,
some files and directories were still set to be world readable during 'omd update'. This is now in
line with the other files.
