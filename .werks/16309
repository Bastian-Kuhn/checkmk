With werk #15815 LDAP connection IDs are validated and rewritten if they
contain spaces (possible in 2.1).

Such connection IDs resultet in sync_time files in the web dir, also containing
spaces and lead to an error on user ID validation if you update from 2.1
to 2.2.

This files are now also renamed during the update.
