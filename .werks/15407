This werk introduces a new feature, namely the automatic removal of hosts based on their properties.
This auto-removal is configurable via the new ruleset <i>Automatic host removal</i>. At the moment,
the only configuration option is the amount of time which the Check_MK service of a host spends in
the monitoring status <i>CRITICAL</i> (eg. because the host is down) before this host is removed.

Naturally, by default, the auto-removal is inactive and has to be explicitly activated via the
ruleset mentioned above.
