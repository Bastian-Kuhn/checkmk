When multiple graphics cards were present, the command 'lscpi -s: Invalid bus number'.
This left the section blank and no services were detected.
This fix may cause new services to appear.
For the fix to take effect, the user will need to re-deploy the plugin.
It may also be necessary to run the service discovery manually.
