When multiple graphics cards were present, the command 'lscpi -s: Invalid bus number'.
This left the section blank and no cards were detected in the HW/SW inventory.
This fix may cause new graphics cards to appear in the HW/SW inventory.
For the fix to take effect, the user will need to re-deploy the plugin.
