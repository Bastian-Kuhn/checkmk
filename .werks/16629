Title: Virtual host tree links work for more than three host tag groups

A virtual host tree (Setup > General > Global settings > User interface > Virtual host trees) can be configured with more than three host tag tree levels. Yet, the corresponding views that are linked to from the sidebar element "Virtual host trees" were not able to display more than three rows in the "Host tags" filter and thus only filtered for the first three.
This is fixed. A virtual host tree link as described above now leads to a properly filtered view with all the given host tag filters shown in the filter popup.
