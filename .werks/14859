Title: Event Console: Fix The EC always activates the config written by the previous activation.
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
Component: ec
Date: 1705414424
Edition: cre
Level: 2
Version: 2.2.0p19

The bug was introduced by the werk: [#16012](https://checkmk.com/werk/16012) in version 2.2.0p18.
A workaround would be: make a trivial change to the rules/rule packs (edit description)
and activate the changes. Or reload the EC manually after the initial reload to apply the correct config.
