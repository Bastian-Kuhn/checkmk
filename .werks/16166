Title: ibm storwize: Fix missing data when monitoring nodes
Class: fix
Compatible: compat

Version: 2.2.0p18

lsnodestats command was used for monitoring nodes in IBM Storwize devices.
Storwize devices don't have the lsnodestats command which led to missing data
in ibm_svc_nodestats services.

Now, the IBM SVC agent uses the lsnodestats if it's available and lsnodecanisterstats
otherwise.
