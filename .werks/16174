Title: mongodb_replica_set: Fix replication lag and last replication time
Class: fix

Checkmk previously assumed that timestamps collected from MongoDB oplog
are provided in ms. This wasn't the case, which led to wrong values for
replication lag and last replication time being shown in
the 'MongoDB Replication Lag' service.
