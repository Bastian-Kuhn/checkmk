The "Logfile pattern analyzer" page crashed when the first "Logfile pattern" rule in place did not hold a regex pattern and a later rule did hold a regex pattern.
The rendering of the table of rules would crash with

C+:
Internal error: list index out of range
C-:

This is fixed and all rules are rendered as expected.
