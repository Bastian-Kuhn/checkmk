Without the "add_or_modify_executables" permission users do not have the right
to change any executable run by checkmk, either on the site or via the agent.
The agent config options "python_plugins" and "lnx_remote_alert_handlers" have
not yet checked for that permission.

In the UI "python_plugins" and "lnx_remote_alert_handlers are called
"Python agent plugin execution (UNIX)" and "Remote alert handler (Linux)" respectively.
