Title: Fix possible crash on editing pagetypes

If you edited pagetypes like topics, custom graphs, etc. and tried to save an
unallowed value, e.g. float instead of integer for "Sort order", the error
"UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'new_page_dict' where it is
not associated with a value" occurred.

You will now get a message which value is wrong to correct it before saving the
pagetype.
