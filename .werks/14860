Title: EC: improve handling of non-UTF-8 characters in messages
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
Component: ec
Date: 1708674008
Edition: cee
Level: 1
Version: 2.2.0p23

Previously, the Event Console would show an error such as
"UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x80 in position 0: invalid start byte"
when trying to process a message that contained non-UTF-8 characters.

With this werk, the EC no longer crashes.
Any non-UTF-8 sequence of bytes is replaced with U+FFFD,
the standard Unicode replacement character for an unrecognized character.
