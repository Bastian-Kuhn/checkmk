When configuring a notification rule via the Rest API, you could not
set the value for "match_service_levels" to anything but the default
service levels.  This werk addresses this issue by now allowing any
of the service levels configured to be used.  This change mean that
there is a change to the request schema. Previously, we accepeted
the service level string value, whereas now we accept the integer
value.

Previous schema
```
{"match_service_levels": {
    "state": "enabled",
    "value": {"from_level": "silver", "to_level": "gold"}
    }
}
```

New schema
```
{"match_service_levels: {
    "state": "enabled",
    "value": {"from_level": 10, "to_level": 20}
    }
}
```
